# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Dungeons and Dragons DPR and HPR Calculators

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

First I want to at least be able to build a damage per round and a healing per round calculator. Second I wanna be able to put it up on a website.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will input various character attributes, maybe even all character attributes. Depending on whether the character plays striker/blaster or a healer the calculator will spit out the average damage per round or the average hp restored per round. The damage per round will try to take in even inputs outside of class features such as feats like sharpshooter or great weapon master. It will also try to take into account any homebrew such as crunchy crits which just deal the max damage and then all the dice rolls instead of just doubling the dice. For a healer, levels, classes, and subclasses will be needed to figure out what is the average healing per round.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be that the calculator is running for most classes and even for the classes not working the inputs needed to be given for the character can mostly make up for not being exact though it wouldnt be as accurate as having the class and subclass features programmed in. i.e.) Rogue Assassin not accounting for surprise or assassinate in the first round of combat.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be all of the published classes and subclasses are fully accounted for.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A bring the entire program and connect it to a website.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to learn more about dictionaries, about list of lists, how to generate new lists or dictionaries to at least get all my class information sorted out and ready to use. I will likely need a little help making the calculator though I don't know what exactly yet. The website is where I will need to learn something new the most considering I've never worked on a website before.
