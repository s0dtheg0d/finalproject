Dungeons and Dragons Damage per Round and Healing per Round Calculator

***

Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have created a rudimentary damage per round calculator that can take in inputs from the console and calculate out the damage.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I want to create a gui for the application to eventually implement it into a website. I was thinking I could also do all of this just in html/css and javascript. I'm still on the fence about just making the application with a gui in python or creating a website for it.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Trying to include everything that can possibly change the damage output or the healing output has been extremely tedious. Especially with martials vs spellcasters, different types of feats, different subclasses. There is a lot of data I need to import and order in the application.
